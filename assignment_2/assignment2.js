Write your explanation for Exercise #1 here

Before using the while loop I've tried to do that with a for loop and also using while and making the
counter a array but it wouldn't give the exact answer, then I search how could I repeat a string and I found the
repeat function and then I applied my variables and used the += to increase and reassign a value to my counter inside 
the loop.
